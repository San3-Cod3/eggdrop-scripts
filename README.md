This is a collection of scripts for the [Eggdrop](https://eggheads.org) IRC
bot. Most of them I've written, but some are edited versions of those
written by others.

Note some of these scripts may not work. Sometimes the APIs or webpages
they scrape go away or change and I might not use them any more and not
notice. If one doesn't work, please let me know, and I'll try to fix it. If
it can't be fixed (or I don't want to for some reason), it will be moved
into the deprecated directory.
